### TTRPG Tools
As a ttrpg player, and a hobbyist coder, I decided to work on a project that would also help myself in the future. I use a lot of tables, and rolling on them all can take some time when you are running on the fly. The table roller is meant to help me get through these quicker as well as let me customize tables and have access to them as well.

### Table Roller
- [ ] Read all YAML files from tables directory
- [ ] Rules for expected structure of YAML files
- [ ] Create menus based on loaded YAML files
- [ ] Linking tables - tables can be linked to another table to auto roll on linked table
- [ ] Create new tables in app
- [ ] Edit tables in app
- [ ] Save tables
- [ ] Reload tables
- [ ] Load tables from included directories
