#
# This is a collection of example tables.
#
---
# - This example shows the use of standard roll notation and standard results
#   for the roll. All results must be entered.
table-name: "Example Table 1"
roll: "1d6"
result:
  1: "Example A"
  2: "Example B"
  3: "Example C"
  4: "Example D"
  5: "Example E"
  6: "Example F"

---
# - This examaple shows that if there is an odd number of results, or you are 
#   constantly changing the table, you can use 'length' to auto calculate the
#   roll. Results must start from 1. All results must be entered
table-name: "Example Table 2"
roll: "length"
result:
  1: "Example A"
  2: "Example B"
  3: "Example C"
  4: "Example D"
  5: "Example E"

---
# - This example shows how to link tables, the table must be loaded, otherwise
#   it will just output the results as written.
# - Linking a table should be [<Number of rolls OR roll notation>@<Table Name>]
# - Result 4 is an example of rolling again on a table without rerolling a third
#   time.
table-name: "Example Table 3"
roll: "1d4"
result:
  1: "Nothing linked"
  2: "Roll Twice on Example Table 2[2@Example Table 2]"
  3: "Roll once on [1@Example Table 1]"
  4: "Roll twice on Example Table 3, between results 1-3 [2d3@Example Table 3]"
